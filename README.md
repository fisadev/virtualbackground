# ViBa: virtual backgrounds

Fake webcam that replaces your background with a custom image of your choice.

This is a **work in progress**, but it is already usable :) Linux only, though (sorry!).

![example](https://github.com/fisadev/virtualbackground/raw/master/example.png)


# Installation

### 1. Fake webcam device

You will need to do some weird stuff first: adding a kernel module to be able to have "fake" webcams.
This is done using the `v4l2loopback-dkms` package. On Debian or Ubuntu, you can install and configure it like this:

```bash
    # install the virtual webcams module
    sudo apt-get install v4l2loopback-dkms

    # create a config so the module is loaded and a cam is created on boot
    echo options v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=20 card_label="viba_cam" exclusive_caps=1 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/viba_cam.conf
    echo v4l2loopback | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/viba_cam.conf

    # enable the module for the first time
    sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback
    sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
```

This means that from now on, you will have a `/dev/video20` device that simulates being a webcam.

### 2. Python libs

Then you need to install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file, as usual with python. 
A virtualenv is recommended:

```bash
    # create and activate the virtualenv
    python3.7 -m venv my_viba_venv
    source my_viba_venv/bin/activate

    # upgrade pip, and then install the dependencies
    pip install pip --upgrade
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Usage

Just run the `viba.py` script, with your virtualenv activated:

```bash
    # activate viba's virtualenv
    source my_viba_venv/bin/activate

    # run viba
    python viba.py
```

The script allows for a number of params to customize how the virtual background works:

```man
Options:
  --background TEXT               The background image to use in the webcam.
  --use-gpu                       Force the use of a CUDA enabled GPU, to
                                  improve performance. Remember that this has
                                  extra dependencies, more info in the README.

  --real-cam-resolution <INTEGER INTEGER>...
                                  The resolution of the real webcam. We highly
                                  recommend using a small value because of
                                  performance reasons, specially if you aren't
                                  using a high end GPU with viba. The value
                                  must be a tuple with the structure: (width,
                                  height). Example: --real-cam-resolution 640
                                  480

  --fake-cam-resolution <INTEGER INTEGER>...
                                  The resolution of the fake webcam. We
                                  recommend using a small value because of
                                  performance reasons, but this isn't as
                                  important as the real cam resolution. Also,
                                  useful info: some web conference services
                                  like Jitsi ignore webcams bellow 720p. The
                                  value must be a tuple with the structure:
                                  (width, height). Example: --fake-cam-
                                  resolution 640 480

  --real-cam-fps INTEGER          The speed (frames per second) of the real
                                  webcam.

  --real-cam-device TEXT          The linux device in which the real cam
                                  exists.

  --fake-cam-device TEXT          The linux device in which the fake cam
                                  exists (the one created using v4l2loopback.

  --model-name [mobilenet_quant4_100_stride16|mobilenet_quant4_075_stride16]
                                  The tensorflowjs model that will be used to
                                  detect people in the video. If you have
                                  trouble with performance, you can try using
                                  'mobilenet_quant4_075_stride16', which is a
                                  little bit faster.

  --segmentation-threshold FLOAT RANGE
                                  How much of the image will be considered as
                                  a 'person'. A lower value means less
                                  confidence required, so more regions will be
                                  considered as a 'person'. A higher value
                                  means the opposite. Must be a value between
                                  0 and 1.

  --debug                         Debug mode: print a lot of extra text during
                                  execution, to debug issues.
```

# Usage as a lib

You can also use it from your own programs. Just take a look at the `main` function in `viba.py`, that's a perfect example and very simple.

# SPEEEED: using GPU for better performance

If you have a Nvidia GPU, you can benefit from a huge performance boost. 
But it comes at the cost of needing to install complex stuff. You will need:

- Nvidia drivers able to run CUDA 10.0 or higher (that means, at least drivers version 410.48).
- CUDA 10.0 or higher.

If you have both, then you can install the extra python dependencies from `gpu_requirements.txt`, and use the `--use-gpu` parameter with `viba.py`.

# Some implementation details, and understanding speed

Currently ViBa works like this:

It has a loop which is capturing frames, applying a "mask" to remove the background leaving only the humans, 
then mixing the humans with the fake background, and finally sending the constructed "frame" to the fake webcam.

That "mask" is calculated using the Bodypix models published by the folk from Tensorflow. It's basically an
artificial neural network able to detect and segment people in images.

Ideally, for each new frame we get from the real webcam we would want to calculate the mask again, because the 
persons are moving around. But the mask calculation is sadly too slow to do in real time. So instead we do this: 
there's a second **concurrent** loop which is always looking at the newest frame, and calculating the mask for it, 
as fast as it can.

The main frames loop uses the latest calculated mask, and the masks loop uses the newest frame when building
a new mask. That means that most of the time, the frames are cropped using a relatively recent mask, which in real 
life means (most of the time) a relatively similar frame. 

So ViBa will work ok if you don't move too fast in front of the camera. If you do, the mask will get "obsolete" too 
fast, and we it won't be able to calculate masks fast enough to follow you around. For a typical conference call
this isn't a problem, but don't try to do acrobatics with an intergalactic background, because people will just see a 
confusing and slow moving space-themed blob :)

Of course, this depends a lot on the performance of your computer, and wether you are using a GPU or not.

Finally, if you want to get really technical: why async? Because when running on GPU the CPU is idle while the mask 
is being calculated. Awaiting that with a thread executor (because sadly, tensorflow isn't async), means we can keep 
doing all the other stuff with the CPU while the mask is bussy in the GPU, and we don't have to worry about locks, 
inter-thread or inter-process communications, etc.

# Acknowledgments

This is heavily inspired in Benjamin Elder's [blog post](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/). 
Though I went the python-tensorflow way instead of the nodejs-tensorflow way, and async + threaded executor instead 
of having separated containers and communications between them. Some parts are very similar, still (like how the mask 
is applied once it's calculated).

Also, [this example](https://github.com/ajaichemmanam/simple_bodypix_python) by @ajaichemmanam was super useful to 
understand how to import tensorflowjs models to python.

And of course, a huge thanks to the people who built the [Bodypix models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix).
